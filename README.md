### Approach Taken:

Mo'Gram is a social media platform that allows users to create and view posts. Each post has a header that represents who created the post, a section for the user to include an image, and a caption section that allows the user to share their story of their post. While a user is able to create their own post, they also have the ability to communicate with other users by adding a "like" or a comment to other user posts.

Implementing C.R.U.D. (Create, Read, Update, & Delete) and the 7 Restful Routes, I was able to create an homepage that displays posts of users, a page that displays a single post, and pages that allows user to add and edit posts.

By using the IDs of the created comments, I was able to insert those IDs number into the array of the post Schema and link the comment to the specific post. This allows users to make a comment on a specific post and have those comments appear only when that specific post is being viewed.
